++ 1st experiment train run
- Tom's code, fixed right arm position (remove randomness added)
- Random factor for get_start_position() = 0.15
- note:
1. original random factor (0.05) limits movement -> for the range of movement arm would not be able to pick up object regardless -> 
2. randomness in right arm removed -> needs increased randomness in left arm
3. training it to move left arm, so randomness should be in left arm?
4. Needs to investigate fissure movement - left forearm bends after attempt then forced back to position for move_vertical() -> can be fixed?

+ training speed: 10000 steps /4hrs -> 42/min

++ Speed up test
- run gzserver not gzclient -> set gui to false
- increase ratio of simulation time to real-time -> set real time update rate = 0
- log frequency in Atari: 100 (-progFreq option) (to time)

***REPORT MATERIAL***
+ training speed at 5000 steps
disable gui + ratio: 100 steps/min
disable gui + default ratio: 40 steps/min
enable gui + ratio = 100 steps/min


- Implement net input test method (visualisation)
- adapted test.lua for BaxterEnv (in progress)

Gazebo world physics properties
- The real time update rate parameter specifies in Hz the number of physics updates that will be attempted per second. If this number is set to zero, it will run as fast as it can. Note that the product of real time update rate and max step size represents the target real time factor, or ratio of simulation time to real-time.
- The max step size specifies the time duration in seconds of each physics update step.

19th May
++ completed and tested test.lua -> working
- input from DepthMap is 4-channel greyscale
- not 1 channel as expected

++ completed architecture of BaxterNet (1st version)

TODO:
1. redo cropping (both: top, RGB: left (+ right?) D: left + right
2. resize (60 - 80 px)
3. adapt tensor size to 1,2)
4.1 Demystify depth image structure
4.2 Rendering difference rivz vs. image.display -> diff image handling methods?
5. Check camera image-taking timing
