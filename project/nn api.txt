View

module = nn.View(sizes)
This module creates a new view of the input tensor using the sizes passed to the constructor. The parameter sizes can either be a LongStorage or numbers. The method setNumInputDims() allows to specify the expected number of dimensions of the inputs of the modules. This makes it possible to use minibatch inputs when using a size -1 for one of the dimensions. The method resetSize(sizes) allows to reset the view size of the module after initialization.

Example 1:

> x = torch.Tensor(4, 4)
> for i = 1, 4 do
>    for j = 1, 4 do
>       x[i][j] = (i-1)*4+j
>    end
> end
> print(x)

SpatialConvolution

module = nn.SpatialConvolution(nInputPlane, nOutputPlane, kW, kH, [dW], [dH], [padW], [padH]))
Applies a 2D convolution over an input image composed of several input planes. The input tensor in forward(input) is expected to be a 3D tensor (nInputPlane x height x width).

The parameters are the following:
 * nInputPlane: The number of expected input planes in the image given into forward(). 
 * nOutputPlane: The number of output planes the convolution layer will produce. 
 * kW: The kernel width of the convolution
 * kH: The kernel height of the convolution 
 * dW: The step of the convolution in the width dimension. Default is 1. 
 * dH: The step of the convolution in the height dimension. Default is 1.
 * padW: Additional zeros added to the input plane data on both sides of width axis. Default is 0. (kW-1)/2 is often used here.
 * padH: Additional zeros added to the input plane data on both sides of height axis. Default is 0. (kH-1)/2 is often used here.

Note that depending of the size of your kernel, several (of the last) columns or rows of the input image might be lost. It is up to the user to add proper padding in images.

If the input image is a 3D tensor nInputPlane x height x width, the output image size will be  nOutputPlane x owidth x oheight where

owidth  = (width  - kW) / dW + 1
oheight = (height - kH) / dH + 1 .
The parameters of the convolution can be found in self.weight (Tensor of size  nOutputPlane x nInputPlane x kH x kW) and self.bias (Tensor of size nOutputPlane). The corresponding gradients can be found in self.gradWeight and self.gradBias.

The output value of the layer can be precisely described as:

output[i][j][k] = bias[k]
  + sum_l sum_{s=1}^kW sum_{t=1}^kH weight[s][t][l][k]
                                    * input[dW*(i-1)+s)][dH*(j-1)+t][l]

======================================
SpatialBatchNormalization

module = nn.SpatialBatchNormalization(N [,eps] [, momentum] [,affine]) where N = number of input feature maps eps is a small value added to the standard-deviation to avoid divide-by-zero. Defaults to 1e-5 affine is a boolean. When set to false, the learnable affine transform is disabled. Defaults to true

Implements Batch Normalization as described in the paper: "Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift" by Sergey Ioffe, Christian Szegedy

The operation implemented is:

   y =     ( x - mean(x) )
        -------------------- * gamma + beta
       standard-deviation(x)
where the mean and standard-deviation are calculated per feature-map over the mini-batches and pixels and where gamma and beta are learnable parameter vectors of size N (where N = number of feature maps). The learning of gamma and beta is optional.

In training time, this layer keeps a running estimate of it's computed mean and std. The running sum is kept with a default momentup of 0.1 (unless over-ridden) In test time, this running mean/std is used to normalize. (Note that the running mean/std will not be saved if one only checkpoints a model's parameters. In order to correctly use the calculated running mean/std, one needs to checkpoint the model itself (call clearState() first to save space).)

The module only accepts 4D inputs.

-- with learnable parameters
model = nn.SpatialBatchNormalization(m)
A = torch.randn(b, m, h, w)
C = model:forward(A)  -- C will be of size `b x m x h x w`

-- without learnable parameters
model = nn.SpatialBatchNormalization(m, nil, nil, false)
A = torch.randn(b, m, h, w)
C = model:forward(A)  -- C will be of size `b x m x h x w`

===============================================
ReLU

f = nn.ReLU([inplace])
Applies the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function element-wise to the input Tensor, thus outputting a Tensor of the same dimension.

ReLU is defined as:

f(x) = max(0, x)
Can optionally do its operation in-place without using extra state memory:

f = nn.ReLU(true) -- true = in-place, false = keeping separate state.

====================================================
ELU

f = nn.ELU([alpha[, inplace]])
Applies exponential linear unit (ELU), which parameter a varies the convergence value of the exponential function below zero:

ELU is defined as:

f(x) = max(0, x) + min(0, alpha * (exp(x) - 1))

The output dimension is always equal to input dimension.
In-place operation defined by third argument boolean.
